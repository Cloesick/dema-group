## Strategic Implications for DEMA Group

### Opportunities

1. **TVH Partnership Potential**
   - TVH lacks pump/irrigation expertise
   - They have agricultural presence (Bepco) but not irrigation
   - 15 km proximity enables collaboration
   - D'Ieteren backing means capital for partnerships

2. **Kramp Dealer Opportunity**
   - Kramp needs local dealers
   - DEMA has agricultural customer base
   - Non-competing (Kramp is B2B only)

3. **Sodeco Partnership**
   - Sodeco has Richter partnership model
   - Could replicate for pump manufacturers
   - Complementary products (valves + pumps)

4. **Avoid Rubix/ERIKS Direct Competition**
   - Both are consolidating aggressively
   - Focus on niches they don't serve well
   - Agricultural, irrigation, SME customers

### Threats

1. **ERIKS Expansion**
   - REIFF acquisition adds Belgium presence
   - Séric adds valve expertise
   - Aggressive acquisition strategy

2. **Narviflex/Dovesco**
   - Private equity backing
   - May acquire smaller conveyor belt competitors
   - Threat to Beltz247

3. **TVH Scale**
   - If TVH decides to enter pumps seriously
   - Their logistics and scale are unmatched

### Recommended Actions

| Priority | Action | Target | Timeline |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Explore TVH partnership | TVH Parts | Q1 2025 |
| 2 | Apply for Kramp dealer status | Kramp | Q1 2025 |
| 3 | Monitor ERIKS Belgium expansion | ERIKS/REIFF | Ongoing |
| 4 | Strengthen Beltz247 position | Before Narviflex moves | Q2 2025 |
| 5 | Build manufacturer relationships | Like Sodeco/Richter | Q2 2025 |
